                <h1>Potential Benefits</h1>
                <br>

                Emotional support: AI companions can offer steady comfort and a non-judgmental presence, which can be especially helpful for people who struggle with loneliness or anxiety.
                <br><br>

                Availability: An AI is always there. It doesn’t get tired or distracted, so people can talk to it anytime they need to vent or reflect.
                <br><br>

                <h1>Potential Drawbacks</h1>
                <br>

                Emotional dependency: Relying too much on AI for connection can make it harder to form or maintain relationships with real people.
                <br><br>

                Lack of reciprocity: No matter how lifelike it seems, an AI doesn’t actually feel emotions or have needs of its own, which means the bond is one-sided.
                <br><br>

                Distorted expectations: After spending time with an AI that always listens and responds perfectly, people might start expecting the same from humans—and feel frustrated when reality doesn’t match.
