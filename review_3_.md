# Our Review

## Interest of Content

Topics are interesting to discuss. But no connection explained related to LLM and the other two pages.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation

- No visuals were found.
- Consistent use of Bootstrap styling.
- Consider improving consistency in file namings, e.g. `AI-` vs `AI.

## Quality of written presentation

- AI Boyfriend & AI Girlfriend: Contents are not rich enough to be called an "article" page.
- LLMs: Consider using paragraphs instead of point form for more formal writing.
- Consider adding more research **with** citations.

## Validity of HTML

No major issue found &mash; great HTML structure.

## Evidence of collaboration

None was found. Consider adding author names under page headings/footer.
